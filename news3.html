        <h2>Ondo Commissioner Of Health Dies of Coronavirus</h2>
        Wahab Adegbenro, Ondo State Commissioner for Health, is dead, SaharaReporters can confirm.
        A government official confirmed the news to our correspondent on Thursday afternoon.
        The source revealed that Mr Adegbenro died on Thursday after he was rushed to a hospital in Owo after contracting Coronavirus.
        "The Commissioner died at the Federal Medical Centre in Owo and this has just thrown the entire cabinet into chaos.
        "He died of COVID-19 because he had contracted the virus earlier and was taking drugs at his own comfort being a medical doctor."
        Governor of the state, Rotimi Akeredolu, is currently in self-isolation after testing positive for the virus earlier this week.
